# Obsidian Configs

This is my configuration of Obsidian for note taking. 

## âš  Important Note

1. Clone the repository and rename the folder to differentiate between actual `.obsidian` folder and add the folder name to <u>Settings > About > Override config folder</u>.
2. I added my templates folder which contains my custom templates. So, if you want to use my templates just move it to your vault.
